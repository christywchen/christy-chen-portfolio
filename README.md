# Christy Chen - Portfolio

A passion project I undertook as a means of creative expression and to challenge myself to experiment with the [react-spring](https://react-spring.io/) animation library. This project also serves as a showcase for the projects I've worked on.

The site's design and color story takes its inspiration from the Bauhaus movement of the 20th century. In my research, I was particularly drawn to and inspired by a [Bauhaus Animation](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ei2FtOJIw9Y) art video by Verena Stippe.
