A passion project I undertook as a means of creative expression and to challenge myself to experiment with the [react-spring](https://react-spring.io/) animation library. I also took on the challenge of deploying on AWS EC2 for the first time along with setting up SSL certifications through CertBot.

This project also serves as a showcase for the projects I've worked on.

The site's design and color story takes its inspiration from the Bauhaus movement of the 20th century. In my research, I was particularly drawn to and inspired by a [Bauhaus Animation](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ei2FtOJIw9Y) art video by Verena Stippe as well as a Bauhaus student's [color exploration](https://d33wubrfki0l68.cloudfront.net/2efe3a3f4c46e8a85aeec32b2022651ed625dbdd/1aa7d/img/fig-34.jpg) dated between 1931-1933.
