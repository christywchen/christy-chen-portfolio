                                Having spent most of my life shuffling between the Bay Area and Los Angeles, Iâ€™ve always had a West Coast mentality. Rather than getting lost in the daily grind, I prefer seeking joy in the meaningful experiences of everyday life. For some time, I had transformed my affinity for mindful living into a more complex skill: Crafting integrated online marketing campaigns that help brands tell meaningful, authentic stories.

                                These days, I still tell stories and still seek to create, but my means has shifted.

                                As a software engineer, my toolkit now includes a wide breadth of technologies. I'm leveraging my past experience in digital marketing, ecommerce, and analyzing user behavior to develop full-stack applications that bring joy to not only my world, but hopefully those of others as well.
